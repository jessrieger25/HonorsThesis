# Ficino G* Grpah Descriptions

###Introduction

This file describes the meaning of the G* grpahs that are produced as a 
result of the positional analysis scripts within this project. It describes each
graph that is present, what the parameters for the analysis were, and how to interpret the graph.

### Graph Types

###### Within Range Graphs

These graphs show a connected graph with one center vertex that has a bunch of spokes coming off it. 
The center vertex represents the keyword that was tracked in the analysis. The spokes represent the keywords
that were found within the given word range of the tracked keyword. The color of the spokes represents their membership
in a particular category. 

###### Average Distance Graphs

These graphs show an unconnected graph with a vertex for each keyword on the keywords list. The large black vertex
represents the vertex that was provided as the tracked keyword. The other vertices show their average distance from the
tracked keyword through their size; the larger the vertex, the closer the word was to the tracked keyword. Again, color 
represents membership in a particular category.
