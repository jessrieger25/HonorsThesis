Were the soul not immortal, no creature would be more miserable than man. 
Since man's mind is never at rest, his body is frail and he is totally without resources, the life he leads on earth is harsher than that of the beasts. Had nature set exactly the same term to his life as she has to the other creatures, no animal would be more miserable than man. But man by his worship of God comes closer to God than all other mortal things, and God is the author of happiness. So it is utterly impossible that man should be the most unhappy of all. However, only after the death of the body can man become any happier. It seems therefore to follow of necessity that once our souls leave chis prison, some other light awaits them. 1 Our human minds, "immured in darkness and a sightless dungeon,'' 2 may look in vain for that light, and we are often driven to doubt our own di­vine provenance. But I pray that as heavenly souls longing with desire for our heavenly home we may cast off the bonds of our ter­restrial chains; cast them off as swiftly as possible, so that, uplifted on Platonic wings and with God as our guide, we may By unhin­dered to our ethereal abode, where we will straightway look with joy on the excellence of our own human nature.
In order to show clearly how best the minds of men can unlock the bars of mortality, witness their own immortality and thus achieve a state of blessedness, I shall try, as best I can, to prove in the following discussion: [first,] that besides this inert mass of our bodies, to which the Democriteans, Cyrenaics and Epicureans limit their consideration, 3 there exists an active quality or power, to which the Stoics and Cynics direct their investigation;4 and

[second] that beyond quality, which is divisible along with matter's dimensions and subject to all manner of change, there exists a higher sort of form, which, though it is in a certain sense change­able, admits of no division in a body. In this form the ancient theologians located the seat of the rational soul. This was the point {in the argument] reached by Heraclitus, Marcus Varro and Marcus Manilius.' I shall also attempt to show that beyond ra­tional soul exists angelic mind, which is not only indivisible but unchangeable as well. This is the point where Anaxagoras and Hermotimus rested content.' But the eye of angelic mind, which seeks for and finds the light of truth, is ruled by the divine Sun it­self. It is towards this that Plato urges, instructs and enjoins us to direct the gaze of the mind, once it has been purified. 7 
Once we have ascended so far, we shall compare in turn these five levels of being: body (bodily mass), quality, soul. angel and God. Because the genus of rational soul, which occupies the mid­point of these five levels, appears to be the link that holds all na­ture together-it controls qualities and bodies while it joins itself with angel and with God-I shall demonstrate: [first,] that it is in fact completely indissoluble, because it holds together the different levels of nature; next, that it is preeminent, because it presides over the framework of the world; and finally, that it is most blessed when it steals into the bosom of the divine. I shall seek to establish that the condition and nature of soul is such as I have described, firstly by general arguments, secondly by specific proofs, thirdly by signs, and lastly by resolving questions. 

Body does not act of its own nature. 

According to Plato, body is made up of matter and of quantity. It is characteristic of matter only to be extended in space and affected. by action; and extension and being affected are passive conditions. But quantity is nothing but the extension of matter; or, if it is anything else, it is such that it is always subject to divi­sion even as it subjects matter to an unending sequence of experi­ences and has no affect on any other matter than its own. It fol­lows from all this chat body in itself does not act but solely is acted upon.
The same point becomes clear from the following argument. For each natural action to be accomplished, three requirements must be met: first, the agent must be most powerful in itself; sec­ond, it must be most ready for motion; and third, it must easily penetrate the object being acted. upon, so that the object is imme­diately united. with the agent. The mass of the body seems to be a hindrance to all of these conditions. In the first place, because of the extension of the body in many parts, the acting force in it is dispersed and distant &om itself and broken up to the utmost de­gree. Power increases with union, but diminishes with dispersion. Dryness, for instance, increases the intensity both of heat and of cold by uniting it; dampness weakens it by dispersing it. Secondly, the larger a body is, the more sluggish it is; by its very nature it is unsuited for motion. So the bigger a body grows, the slower it is to move, and the longer the action is delayed. The power of light­ness, for instance, makes a spark fly up more rapidly than a Aame; the power of heaviness makes a log fall more rapidly if it is pointed than if it is wide. Thirdly, since any body fills its own space and one space cannot accommodate two bodies, bodies cannot coalesce in one space: their solidity and density prevent them fi-om pene­trating one another. To sum up, the space between parts weakens the power to act, the bulk of bodily mass retards motion, and den­sity impedes bodies' penetration. What is worse, if nature forces the scattered parts of a body together in order to increase its power by union, the body becomes denser meanwhile and less suitable for penetration. H nature makes it less dense in order to facilitate motion and penetration, the power of acting is dispersed forthwith. And so, since these three conditions are required for ac­complishing action, body either possesses three other conditions hostile to these three, or it accepts one of them but not another. What body would need is smallness, lightness, and lack of density all at the same time; but these would take it back to being a cer­tain incorporeal habit. 9 So all power of acting must be attributed to an incorporeal nature.

Isn't it from quantity that we have a multitude of parts in the agent, in the patient, and in the space between them? Because of the first, an action which would otherwise have been very vigorous is very sluggish; because of the second, what would have been completed instantaneously is gradually accomplished; because of the third, what would have been done rapidly takes a long time to finish. So vigorous, rapid and instantaneous action seems to be­long to some sort of incorporeal force. Take fire, for instance. Be­cause of its rarity it comes closer to the nature of spirit than the other elements. Of all the elements it is the most effective agent, however. In scarcely a moment it can perform what it takes other bodies a long time to do. It does not admit of any blending with other elements, as is the case with other bodies. With a single spark, if there is fuel enough, it will fill almost the whole world. The other elements do not extend themselves out so far, so quickly or so vigorously. It is because fire is so fine and subtle that it becomes powerful. Because it becomes powerful, it extends out­wards, not the other way around. It is capable too of giving light, 

which is regarded as incorporeal, and the action of light is instantaneous. Another example: a little air at the top of a barrel keeps the barrel floating on the water's surface, even if it is loaded down with the weight of many stones. Lightning and cannon-fire too demonstrate quite clearly the power of air and fire. As a final argument one can note that the heavens, which arc the least dense of all, are the most remarkable for their light, motion and power to act. If a body becomes a more effective agent the closer it is to the incorporeal, is it not obvious that the power of acting resides in an incorporeal nature? 
We can grasp the same point in the following way. What is first in nature, that is, God, acts on everything but is never acted upon. So what is last, that is, corporeal matter (or body], has to be acted upon by everything. It can never act on anything else of itself, for nothing exists below it which could be the subject of its action. And if in the highest unity, being infinite, there exists an infinite power of acting, then in infinite plurality there exists no power of acting at all but rather an infinite capacity for being acted upon. The Pythagoreans think that body is infinite plurality, because it is endlessly divisible. So if bodies appear to act in any way, they do not do so by virtue of their own mass, as the Democritcans, Cyrenaics and Epicureans supposed, but through some force and quality implanted in them. This is hardly surprising. For action arises in natural bodies when opposition arises between contraries. Such opposition is born in the genus of qualities. 10
Furthermore, the same matter and the same indefinite spatial
extension underlie all bodies. So if action proceeded from matter 
or extension, all would act in the same way. As it is, since the actions of different bodies are obviously different, they do not act
through a single matter and extension, but through their own distinctive forms and qualities. By virtue of what they are, properly
speaking, they also act. But they are in this or that species, not 
because of their mass, but because of a particular form. So it is through form chat they acc. This is for (three] particular reasons. To begin with, an agent first approaches the object to be acted upon by way of form's qualities before doing so through the limits of quantity. Next, it is through the power of form, not through quantitative extension, chat it can pass into alien matter. And fi­nally, it reaches each individual point of chat matter not through extension but through quality. It is by coldness that water gets cold. It is by heat, not mass, chat fire gets hot. Fires do not burn because they extend far, but because they are extremely hot. In­deed, if all its heat were concentrated into a single point, its power co burn would become most intense, because of the high degree of unification. Thus action arises thanks to quality, especially when quality is concentrated.

That is why natural causes produce effects like themselves in quality rather than equal to chem in quantity. If occasionally the effects do rumour to be equal in size, they have to have first ap­peared very similar in appearance {an action accomplished as it were by qualities). Afterwards, necessarily, in and through their qualities, the effects resemble their causes. Thus almost all chil­dren resemble their parents in complexion and features when they are newborn, but equal them in size only occasionally and much later. The point is obvious to anyone. You do not become big by approaching a big body; but you certainly get hot if you approach something hot. Nor do you perceive quantity with any of your senses unless one sense has first been affected by quality. For who can judge the size of a wall unless color and light have brought its bigness before the eye. Further, the judging of quantity is lost with distance more and earlier than the judging of light or color. It is as though motion's efficacy consists in quality.
The point is dearly demonstrated by the fact that our desire is aroused by something because it is good, not because it is large or multiple; and goodness is a quality. Otherwise we would always choose what is larger or more numerous. In fact, with chose things

we deem evils, we choose the smaller or the fewer. Quality cannot be body, however, because two bodies cannot be brought together in the same space without mutual repulsion, whereas several quali­ties can be blended together in the same object. The matter of honey, for instance, always possesses a combination of three quali­ties, yellowness, sweetness and fragrance. Every drop of honey is yellow. sweet and fragrant in the nostrils. Again, every body by its very nature is extended in length, breadth and depth. But quality by its very nature appears to be unextended, otherwise no quality would not be extended somewhere. Yet some qualities that are unextended are present in the point, in unity, in number, in har­mony, in powers. So quality is not body. Indeed, if extension were 
natural to it, the bigger it became, the stronger it would be; but being dispersed in extension makes it weaker. 
So quality, indivisible itself in a way, suffers division in the extension of body. Division of course happens only by reason of quantity; for division always proceeds from the one into the many. Yet quality preserves some property of its indivisible nature even when it is in a body. For, as the Platonists put it,11 the whiteness which is in a particular part of a white body should properly not be called part of the whiteness which is in the whole body. It should be called the whiteness of a part rather than part of the whiteness. Suppose you cut a white body into several parts: in each individual part will remain the same rational principle of whiteness, and the power and like action of whiteness; but the size will not be the same or equal.
Hence division, strictly speaking, is not a characteristic of quality, but of body by reason of its quantity. Action pertains to qual­ity, especially when quality is concentrated. So quality is not body; and when it is concentrated in a single point, it becomes totally in­corporeal. Hence the activity of bodies does not arise from matter, but from the power of an incorporeal nature.

Above the form that is divided in body there exists an indivisible form, namely soul. 
So far we have ascended from body to quality. Quality is the name I we give, in the Platonic manner, to all form which appears, divided up, in body. But should we stop at this point as the Stoics and Cynics do? Certainly not. Quality is a sort of form. Form's nature is simple, effective, swift to act. That is why the natural philoso­phers often call it "act." Such a nature is contaminated when it is in the bosom of matter. Instead of being simple, it becomes divisi­ble and impure; instead of being active, it becomes subject to pas­sion, to being acted upon; instead of being swift to act, it becomes clumsy and incompetent. So this sort of form is neither pure nor true nor perfect. Ifit is not pure, it cannot be the primary form. For everything must first exist as a pure example of its kind before it is corrupted. 
Again, if quality is not the true, it cannot be the primary form. For how can the mind prove it is not entirely true, unless it can turn away to perceive another truer form in comparison with which quality is found wanting and shown to be in a manner false? Where then does the mind see the true form? It must either gaze outside itself or within. If it looks outside itself, then a true form, superior to quality, exists somewhere in nature. If the mind gazes within, then a true form is not absent from the mind, and therefore not absent from the world.
Furthermore, the truth is stronger than what is false, since the truth can exist without the false, whereas the false cannot exist without the truth. For nothing can be said to be false unless it is true that it is false. Nothing has validity unless it is true that it has validity. If a thing is truly understood to be false, then it is by truth that this is understood. A thing is not called false unless it deceives, and it does not deceive except by the appearance of truth. So if the truth is stronger than the false, and if the form that is less true, namely quality, exists as something in the order of things, then a fortiori a true form must exist in the order of things. In particular, insofar as intellect is superior to and truer than sense, intelligible form must be superior to and truer than sensible form. So it is clear that quality cannot be the primary form, be­cause it is not pure and because it is not true.


The same conclusion follows from its not being perfect. For the primary member of any genus is the principle of the whole genus. \\!hat is the principle of other things contains all that follow upon it. So what is first in its genus lacks nothing of its genus. The Sun, for instance, being first among luminaries, lacks no degree of light, whereas the other luminaries inferior to it, such as the stars and the elements, do not possess the full plenitude of light. The pri­mary form therefore contains all the perfections of the subsequent forms and so cannot be imperfect. We are thus correct in conclud­ing that a form described as imperfect cannot be the primary form.
Because quality inheres in matter in such a way that it is expanded and divided together with matter, one could say that in the end it becomes material, and, if it is separated from matter, corrupted. It does not sustain itself but is sustained by matter as though by a substrate. If a thing cannot sustain itself, much less can it exist on its own. As it lies fallow in something else, it is cer­tainly dependent on that something. Since quality is liable to change and destruction, it must be born from time to time. But nothing is ever born from itself. For what gives a beginning to what is born must precede what is born. But nothing can precede itself. Since quality is born from something else, and nothing can be born except from something superior to it, quality cannot, therefore, be nature's principle.

But whence does it arise? From matter? Surely not. Matter of itself is a common substrate and possesses no form; it relates co all forms insofar as it can in an identical manner, whatever the occa­sion or the place. How then can it be embellished with different forms at different times and places except by way of something higher that affects it in different ways at different times and places? If matter is to give form to itself, we wish to know whether or not it already possesses that form by way of its own power be­fore it bestows it on itself. Ifit does not possess that form, it can­not in fact conceive it. Ifit does possess it, then it is not prime matter, but something composed from matter and from the power of form.
In that case, we have to inquire about this power. Does matter have it from itself or from another? If from another, then it has the form too from another. If from itself, then does it similarly possess the power because of some other power chat similarly be­longs to it, and so on ad infinitum? Or does it have the power, not through some other power, but through its own essence? In that case, the essence of matter will be the same as the power or the substance that brings forms into being: matter will be the source of forms rather than their substrate. Or rather, matter will be form rather than matter, indeed the highest form of forms at that, the form chat brooks no division. le will not fluctuate ( as it now does) with the variety of fleeting forms, but by virtue of its eternal essence it will be endowed with the eternal forms.
From this we can conclude chat matter in its own name has no power to procreate forms. A formless substrate cannot give itself form, being completely incapable of action, since action comes from form which is the source of being. If the matter which is shaped by arc, although not lacking form, is made not by itself but by the form of art into the form of an artifact, then certainly the matter which is subject to nature, although it is formless, is made not from itself but from the form of nature into a natural form.

Where then does quality come from? Perhaps it is from another quality as one fire generates another? But this cannot be the answer. For quality cannot exist without the kindling of matter, and so is not in control of its own matter, much less matter extra­neous to it. Thus the quality of one body cannot give form to an­other body through its own power alone. The natural body has no power to act through its own mass, which is passive and can only be acted upon. Nor does it have adequate power to act through quality. For the mode of existence of quality is not sufficient to provide body with an adequate mode of activity. A fire, for in­stance, has first to be generated by something before it can gener­ate another; ir needs to be an effect before it can be an efficient cause. It is characteristic of an effect that it depends on something else. If follows then that when fire acts in any way, it acts as the in­strument of a higher cause. For if one particular fire were the first cause of the generation of fire, were, in other words, the highest cause (since any genus as a whole proceeds from the genus's first cause), it would be responsible for the production of all fire when­ever and wherever it occurred. Thus it would be responsible for producing itself and any fire that came either before or after it. But since no particular fire can be the first cause of this kind of genera­tion, we must ask about the cause of which it is (just] the instru­ment. Is it the instrument of another fire? Certainly not: first, be­cause that cause is equal, not superior to it; and second, because the fire from which our fire had originated would either be out by now, or far away. Is it then the instrument of the other (three] ele­ments? Again the answer is no. In dissimilar and contrary ele­ments no rational principle exists for the generation of fire to which this fire (which is about to generate another fire) can be subject as instrument. Could it then be the instrument of heaven?
Far from it. This fire can be the instrument of such a distant body only by way of an intermediary. But the intermediary bodies are not suited to the task. Or rather, one has to posit another fire placed between the heaven or sphere of fire and the other ele­ments, in order to account for the generation of this fire on earth. That other fire will generate this fire, not the reverse. A similar ar­gument will apply to the [other] individual species of natural things. 


Therefore over and above all these quality forms, there must be a certain incorporeal substance [or form) present in and ruling over all objects; and this penetrates the bodies, and the corporeal qualities are its instruments. For how else would individual quali­ties, which are by nature unstable and without order, preserve a stable order in the succession of generation, unless ruled by the stable order of a higher cause? And why should individual quali­ties always return to produce the same effects at certain appointed intervals of time, unless the one and the same cause that leads them at any {one] time were likewise to lead them at appointed times?
The human mind in its day-to-day activities proceeds from particular forms to universal and absolute forms. From natural forms, which are limited co definite bits of matter, it customarily ascends by way of mathematical forms, for which indefinite matter will suffice, to metaphysical forms, which have no need of matter, defi­nite or indefinite. Likewise it ascends from dimensions, which re­quire both location and pares, co the point, which has no parts but in a sense has location; and again from points co numbers which need parts but not location. Finally, it wings its way from numbers to the unity which needs neither parts nor location. It travels be­yond the unity which is indivisible but accidental to the unity which is substantial, in other words to the substantial form; it travels to the indivisible essence, at once the foundation and origin of all that is accidental, as to something fixed, and to the axis, in itself unchanging, of all chat is in itself accidental, changeable, al­ways clinging to another. If the human mind has such a capacity for rational ascent, though it is only a part of the universe and en­cumbered by the chains of the body, even more certainly the uni­verse possesses within itself a far greater capacity for the same as­cent, especially as the order of the lowest mind takes its origin from the order of the universe. What has a more vigorous capacity for action will naturally produce action more quickly and on a larger scale.

If all the universal genera, moreover, are led back to one some thing in their individual genus, which is in a way indivisible and by whose simplicity they exist - for instance, change and time to the moment; natural form to the minimum natural degree; geometri­cal dimensions to figure; numbers to unity - why shouldn't the genus of substance be led back to an indivisible substance? We know that all mathematical figures, which participate in inequality, are led back to the figure of the circle, which is the most equal of all figures; and chat the figure of the circle is led back to the indivisi­ble center, which is the beginning of all equality. In the same way, forms that are accidental and divisible are led back to the form that is substantial and divisible; and this form to the substantial and indivisible form. Similarly, just as beyond quality, which is lia­ble to decrease and even remission, 12 exists the substantial bodily form which is not subject to remission although it can decrease, so above this there must exist the substantial form which can neither fall into remission nor decrease, in order that ascent towards the better may be perfected in the best. Such will be the incorporeal
substance, its principal characteristic being that it cannot be di­
minished. It must exist somewhere in nature according to its 
proper form. 
Indivisible and simple things necessarily come before what are 13 
divisible and composite. For every single thing must exist before it 
can be extended or enlarged. The divisible and composite need the 
indivisible and simple, not the converse; for they arise from them 
and end in them. Therefore, if the divisible and composite exist 
according to their proper form in universal nature, a fortiori it must 

be possible to find the genus too of indivisible and simple things existing somewhere according to their proper form. Given the fact that nature sets its matter in motion more efficiently and to better purpose than art does its matter, we can infer that the principal form in nature dominates its matter more than the principal form in art dominates its. If that is so, two things follow: first, that in terms of position it is closer to its matter than art is to its; and second, that in terms of substance it excels its matter more than art excels its. Thus it is more capable of existing in itself and with­out matter. 
In reaching this conclusion I am particularly swayed by the following argument. All qualities exist as forms in another, and so, whenever they produce forms, they produce them in another. For they cannot beget children more free than they are themselves. They beget forms in the womb of matter. But that form alone that does not subsist in another makes and preserves the matter that does not subsist in another. For matter neither exists of itself-as it is imperfect and does not act of itself-nor does it exist because of qualities that it itself precedes. Rather it exists because of some form that precedes it. Such a form is totally incorporeal. The pow­ers and activities of qualities are based on the power and activity of such an incorporeal form inasmuch as their works are always based on its work. I discuss this further elsewhere.
Here we should recall that matter (and I am quoting the views of Mercurius Trismegistus and Tirnaeus14) is without form. It is not nothing, but it is next to nothing, being primarily and to an unlimited extent that which is acted upon.15 In Plotinus' view it follows from this that the disposition closest to matter, namely di­mension and quality, is completely insubstantial and exists, how­soever insignificantly, as a totally passive state.16 For dimensions are nothing other than extensions of matter itself, and qualities are nothing other than the affections of the same -mere shadows that come and go like the reflections of lofty trees in a rushing stream.

Finally, Plotinus concludes that neither matter, since it is the prime patient, nor dimensions and qualities, since they are the first passive states of the prime patient, can be the first principles of actions. Thus Plotinus. Others, though they reach the same general conclusions, establish different distinctions. They agree that matter itself cannot initiate action; and that quantity too, if it is the passive extension of matter proceeding from some cause that extends matter, can do nothing, since it is the perpetual passive state of the prime patient. But if quantity is a sort of form by means of which the moving cause of matter extends matter, it does perhaps do something to its own matter. For it is the intermediary by means of which that cause appears to extend matter. But quan­tity can do nothing whatsoever to matter other than its own, since an agent is always necessarily distinct from a patient that impedes action. Quality, on the other hand, according to the Aristotelians, can do something both to its own and to alien matter. 
The argument has led us from matter, which acts neither upon 16 its own nor upon alien matter, to quality, which in some way gives motion to both, by way of quantity, which affects only one sort of matter, namely its own. Should we then proceed without some intermediary from quantity, which in no way affects matter other than its own, to something that in the full sense may move matter other than its own? By no means. Yet quality is the closest thing to quantity. So it is not fully capable of action outside itself. If it is crippled when it comes to action, it is controlled by a higher sub­stance which is fully capable. It is not surprising that quality is crippled; for at the moment of its birth it is scattered through the breadth and depths of matter, plunged, one might say, in the stream of Lethe. So every Time it tries to do anything, it is over­whelmed by matter, as by something infecting it. It has not the strength to get the better of matter on its own. So it cannot set anything in motion on its own, but only when strengthened by a higher cause. What gives it strength and direction is a kind of life, which can create life and sensation even out of lifeless mud, as in the generation of frogs and bees; a life which can beget from a pile of ugly dung a variety of beautiful flowers by way of a variety of beautiful seeds, which, as they are not often found in dung, must necessarily be in life itself. Life brings scattered bits of matter into order. Order comes from reason. Reason consists in life. Life con­sists in one indivisible power (for death occurs through division and dissolution). Again, life generates fire from the collision of cold bodies; and when the reflection of the Sun's rays in a mirror or a hot piece of iron, by way of the accidental quality of fire, sets wool aflame, it is this life, by means of the living seeds of fire, that produces the substantial form of fire in the wool.


In us exists something that rather than consuming food all at once, breaks it down and digests it gently and in an orderly way. What do we suppose this is? What is it that brings inanimate foodstuffs to animate form in such a remarkable manner? What continually makes the heavy go upwards and the light downwards as life's need requires without any visible signs of force, in a way that is contrary to, indeed superior to, the nature of the objects? What is it that reconciles and forces unity on these objects in con­flict? Certainly, it is not the simple hear of their fire, nor any of their other qualities; nor is it their divisible nature or their nature's bare property. Rather, it is some higher power, indivisible and life­giving. What we observe in our selves apply to the universe as a whole, and conclude from all these arguments as follows. Bodily forms do not have sufficient power among themselves to generate anything living, but require the assistance of some higher cause. This higher cause, if it too were a form similarly joined to matter, again would itself descend from some further higher substance. Eventually, if we are to avoid infinite regress, we must reach some form which is unmixed with any bodies. But the power in the genus of forms is such that they can exist apart from matter. Even if someone were to claim that in themselves forms are joined but they are separated conceptually by the mind, that person would still have to admit that minds themselves have a separate existence since they separate other things.


This is further shown by the fact that substance is, by nature and rank, prior to quantity and to other accidents. Now because what is prior can exist apart from what is posterior, a substance can exist without quantitative division. If it can exist, then some­where it does exist, lest this perfection [ of substance] be absent in nature, and lest the potentiality [ for substance) be there in vain. For as regards those things which pertain to the eminent order of the universe, whatever can exist either already does exist -as the physicists believe -lest change were to befall what is eternal; or at least it exists at some time, lest something were to remain always without substance. And if life, which precedes sense only in terms of its origin in nature, does at this very moment exist somewhere of itself and without sense, there is all the more reason why sub­stance, which excels quantity in origin as in rank, should now exist somewhere in the order of nature separate from quantity. This is especially the case since the universe would be more perfect if cer­tain substances were free of the chains of quantity than if certain lives were free of sense.
Averroes,17 following Aristotle's view, proves that the corporeal 19 and substantial form of the heavens contains no matter, 18 since the heavens do not possess that potentiality for diverse forms which is the proper nature of matter. The heavens do, however, have di­mension. Averroes believes that the form of dimension exists mid­way between natural forms and divine forms, since natural forms exist together with matter and quantity, and divine forms are to­tally free of both, but the form of the heavens must be midway be­tween the two, lest nature were to proceed from one extreme to another without an intermediary. Averroes considers it reasonable, therefore, that the form of the heavens exists with quantity but not with matter. But I would extend the argument as follows. 


Since substantial form normally subsists in matter rather than in quantity, and since it is, by virtue of the order of its genus and na­ture, proportionately more related to matter than to quantity, then ifit is able to exist somewhere without matter, a fortiori it is able to exist somewhere separated from quantity. 
A further argument. Proclus' opinion was that three types of bodies exist. 19 First some bodies ( to use his terminology) are at once material and composite, such as those compounded from the four elements. Then come the spheres of che elements themselves, which are material, certainly, but in a sense non-composite. Finally come the heavenly bodies, which are at once non-composite and non-material. He also posies, like Averroes, three types of forms. He offers the following general definition of che forms: "Form is that by means of which a thing distinctly both exists in ace and acts."20 This definition entirely excludes the dimensions, but per­haps it does indirectly refer to a substrate when it says "by means of which a thing," etc. He concludes that if some forms can exist without the material substrate, such as the heavenly forms, there is all the more reason why they can and should exist ( and in greater numbers) without dimension.
Proclus and Syrianus offer the following proof of the same 21 proposition. Whatever is extended by something else is necessar­ily confined by dimension, while what does the extending is not. So matter, which is always extended by another, is necessarily sub­ject to dimensions. However, because everything exists in itself in a way before it is extended, we can think of matter as indivisible. All the more so then can the principle by which it is extended not only be thought of as without dimensions, but it can actually be so. Moreover, every divisible object is in a sense one whole com­posed from many parts. If the parts did not possess something that was one and the same and common to them all, they would never form chat whole. For the whole does not become one except from what is one. Again, if they did not participate in unity, none of che pares would be one, but several things, and so on ad infinitum: every pare would be numberlessly infinite. That one thing planted in the pares is not divided up piece-meal in each of the parts, otherwise it coo would need another to unite it. There­fore it is the same and it is whole in the individual parts. Such must be something incorporeal.
Again, since everything corporeal is some one whole composed of parts, what is the cause of its union? Does the whole itself unite the pares or do the parts unite the whole? Or does some­thing higher, which is neither a part of anything nor a whole made up of parts, unite the parts together into a whole? {Then) the whole would be following on che pares rather than uniting them. But if we admit it unites the pares, it will be incorporeal. For if it coo were divisible, it would require something in nun to unite it. Bue if the parts are uniting the whole, we will have the absurd re­sult that union, which should be brought about by unity, is being brought about by plurality, which is the opposite of unity. Conse­quently, beyond the individual parts and the whole, exists one something, the cause of the harmony, which is incorporeal, lest it too is forced into needing a bond ( and so we would go on to infinity).
So we should not suppose that any form divided up in a body is the apex of nature and the principle of things. The universal principle must always have existed, and must always continue to exist, through its own power. le muse always have existed, because it could not have been produced at some time out of itself-for that would involve its pre-existing itself-nor could it have been produced from another -for nothing comes before what is first ( nothing else would ever have existed if the first had not existed first). It will always continue to exist, because, if the principle is once destroyed, the totality of things collapses, and neither the principle itself nor anything else can any more be restored co being.


The principle must, therefore, possess infinite power by virtue of which it can live eternally of itself. It will not have this power if
it is itself corporeal. For had it infinite dimensions, nothing else  
would exist in things except itself. Had it finite dimensions, it  
would have finite power too. I will omit other points elaborated  
elsewhere: that neither body nor bodily form, being imperfect and  
subject to change, can be a sufficient principle of motion, but that  
everything corporeal is set in motion by something else; that a  
craftsman who is intermingled with and affected by his product  
cannot control his work; and that the perfect or first craftsman is  
the architect of the world's edifice.  
Let us pass then beyond bodily form and consider now the primary form which we next encounter. We have ascended from
body, which is, so to speak, at the lowest level, up to corporeal  
form, which is half-way (because it has some aspects of body when  
it is extended in body, but lacks others since it is not itself something composed of matter and form). Now we should proceed
from chis midpoint to the sublimer form, the incorporeal form  
which has none of the characteristics of body, which gives bodies  
their qualities, and which we call the true form or essence since  
it exists through itself. Indeed, this is the third essence, 11 which  
at the appropriate moment we shall call rational soul; the irrational soul accompanies it as a shadow accompanies the body. This
essence the Platonists adjudged both true and immortal, first, because it requires no parts into which it could at some point be
dissolved, or through which its power could be dispersed and  
weakened; second, because it is not bound to any substrate without which it would at some point cease to exist; third, because it is
not mixed with any contrary form, which might contaminate it;  
and lastly because it is nor constrained by place, nor subject to  
rime or morion ( on account of the indivisible and self-abiding simplicity of substance).

In its substance rational soul is motionless; in its activity it is mobile; in its power it is partly motionless and partly mobile. 

How shall we describe the nature of this third essence? Is it totally motionless, or is it subject to motion? We can be sure that it is not entirely motionless, because it is the source of the qualities that flow into matter which are constantly restless. Every cause acts in accordance with its proper nature. So some power and reflection of the cause has to be preserved in what it does. If this essence which is the cause of qualities were totally without motion because it always acted in accordance with its motionless nature, the qual­ity deriving from it would retain some motionless nature in itself. What in fact happens is the opposite. Quality has three compo­nents: essence, power and action. All three are involved in motion. Its essence is generated and corrupted. Generation and corruption are effected through motion. The power of its nature too is inten­sified or remitted. Heat, for example, may be more or less intense. What varies in degree of heat at different times is clearly subject to change. The same is true of its action. The action of fire is to make something hot. It does not make water, for instance, hot in­stantaneously but in time. Now an act in time everyone calls mo­tion. So quality is altogether subject to motion. 
Clearly, therefore, the disposition of bodies brought about by z qualities cannot remain exactly the same and alike for any period of time, but it changes continually either in terms of degree (going from one set of proportions to another) or for better or worse. Were someone to claim that an adult bodily disposition lasted an hour, the Platonists would ask him the following question; Is the power in che disposition the same at the end of the hour as at the beginning? Ifit is not the same, then the power has not remained unchanged for an hour; for during the hour the disposition has changed with respect to its power. If the power is declared to be the same, then the disposition will lase another hour. For equal powers have equal effects. Ifit lasted an hour with a given amount of power, it will last another hour with the same power. Once the second hour is up, the same question can be asked. Is the power the same or not? If not, then the disposition did not last; but if it is the same, then it will last for the same time again. And so the Platonists will proceed like this ad infinitumand demonstrate that the nature of the body, if only it remained the same for an hour or for half an hour, would endure for ever. But no complexion of any body is in its own terms vigorous forever, since all complexions are extinguished in a brief while and perish, and thus they remain the same for hardly a moment of time. Because they begin and end at the same moment -a fully complete habit or condition of existing is incompatible, however, with beginning and ending-and be­cause, in order to act, one needs the act of existing, the argument we reached in the discussion above appears to be confirmed: namely that in qualities a sufficient principle for acting does not exist. 
Let us then return to the question we posed. If there is in qualities qua qualities a motion totally devoid in a way of rest, how can qualities be produced without an intermediary by chat cause which is so far removed from them chat it has rest totally devoid of motion? If all things proceed from one extreme to the other through intermediaries -for instance, we go from winter to sum­mer via spring, from summer to winter via autumn-then be­tween quality, which is fundamentally in motion, and essence, which is completely free from motion, we must necessarily posit something which is partly without motion and partly subject to it. So the substance which is the immediate progenitor of qualities cannot be entirely without motion. What are we to say then? Must we say that this substance is completely subject to motion? No, for either it would be in the genus of bodily qualities -yet we cannot come to a halt in that genus -or the cause which is located in the higher genus would not exceed its own effect with sufficient perfection if the substance which is the cause of quality were as unstable as quality. Therefore the substance must be partly at rest, partly in motion. It, too, has three components: essence, power and activity. Which of these is at rest and which in motion? Its ac­tivity cannot be at rest if the former two are subject to change. Its essence cannot be moved without the latter two being moved. So the first, its essence, will be at rest; the last, its activity, will be sub­ject to change. What about the one in the middle, its power? It will be partly at rest, partly subject to change.

Above mobile soul is motionless angel. 

So far then we have discovered some sort of form above the body's complexion, which we shall call rational soul. Its essence always re­mains the same. This is proved by the stability of the will and the memory. Its activity, however, is liable to change, in that it does not think about all things simultaneously, but step by step; nor does it nourish, increase and generate the body in a single mo­ment, but over the course of time. Natural power remains un­changed, because its natural vigor perpetually thrives, neither in­tensifying nor remitting. But acquired power does change, because it moves from potentiality to act and from act to habit and then back again. This was the point {in the argument] attained by Heraclitus, Varro and Manilius.

But we must ascend further. For this form cannot be the principle of the whole of nature. For activity which is unchanging and performs its cask co complete perfection in a single moment is more perfect than activity which requires time. The life that is at once whole, united with itself. and not distant from itself is more pure and complete than the life that, having been extended over various different moments of time, is pulled apart from itself, one might say, in accordance with its inner actions and feelings. So above this form whose external activity wanders over intervals of time, and whose life, that is, internal activity, is dispersed as it were in a flood, we must posit another form, more sublime, whose activity is constant and whose life is at once whole and united. Since the perfect always takes precedence over the imperfect, it fol­lows that, just as the perfect things in any genus are those which are such by their very nature, so the imperfect are those which are not such (otherwise they would be wholly such). If therefore the imperfect do not exist of themselves, they must exist by way of what are higher.
Whatever is moved rushes out from potency and inactivity into 3 act, seeking some terminus and end-point to its motion, as though it were not sufficient to itself but needed that which its motion di­rects it towards. But beyond what passes from inactivity to act, there always exists something that is full and unceasing act. Above what changes because it is deficient there must be something which does not move because it never needs anything or because it is already completely full. Although what is moved may be changed through [its) desire for improvement, it cannot improve except by acquiring a nature better than or superior to its own. Nor can it have the thing it seeks during motion. It can only acquire it after motion, and not from itself (for in that case no change would have been necessary), but from something else richer and fuller. 
What naturally lacks an end-point must be given one by some


thing more perfect. Anything subject to motion lacks an end-point of itself, because it is not remaining at rest in itself. But if such a thing were the principle of nature, and since it will make every­thing by way of its changeable activity, then there will be no stabil­ity at all in things. Bur, in fact, stability is such a necessary ele­ment in things that even motion itself does not lack stability. For unless something affected by motion in various different ways were nor to remain the same in substance for some period of time, it would not change affections nor alter by degrees, bur altogether cease in an instant. Even the revolution of the heavens, being most ordered around the same center and the same poles, with the equality of its motions and the regular return of the constellations, participates in some stability. Just as what is at rest rests because of unity and is united in its rest (this I will demonstrate elsewhere), so what is moved is moved because of rest and is at rest in motion. When I say it is moved because of rest, it is because of some sta­bility in its motive power. For were it not co remain in its power, it would not preserve any order in its motion; or rather its motion would not even last a short while. Again, it rests in motion, mean­ing it perseveres in the same, equal or like pattern of motion. Many things which are in motion with regard to one species of movement are not in motion with regard to other species; thus, they are partly in motion and partly at rest. Furthermore, since prime matter is eternal, anything chat is changed by way of its substantial form must remain unchanged by way of its matter. A fortiori, what is changed with respect to quantity, quality or loca­tion can, indeed must, remain the while unchanged with respect to substance. In short, what in no way remains when it loses stability is simultaneously forced to lose all motion coo. If, then, any stabil­ity exists in things, the first principle cannot be movable. So what is movable is not nature's principle. Therefore something exists above soul, in order that soul-which by its nature is open equally to understanding and co not understanding, switching as it does from the one to the other in alternation - may be ordered and de­termined for understanding through the influence, in this genus (of understanding}, of that which is always in act. Such a some­thing is what is always understanding or always actually under­stood, which is the same.
Furthermore, what is partly such is only such because of what s exists as wholly such. The log which is partly hot gets its heat from fire which is wholly hot. This is because what is such by its very nature, hot for instance, being totally comprehended by its nature, is totally comprehended by such a quality. On the other hand, what is partly such is not such by way of itself. The third essence, that is, soul, is not in its whole self understanding. For it has other natural characteristics besides understanding and these are without understanding. So mind in the soul is part of the soul bur also in some way part of the mind, of the higher mind, which is totally and only mind. If soul from itself possessed mind, the ra­tional principle for generating mind would exist within the sub­stance of soul, and all soul would thus be mind, mind perfect and complete; and every soul would possess mind, because the rational principle of soul is in every soul. And just as the power to move body, since it belongs to soul by nature, is present in individual souls, so the faculty of understanding would be present in all souls, including those of beasts, if it belonged by nature to soul. If above the nature which is less effective there has to be a nature which is more effective, and if the mind which is in the soul can neither produce by its own act alone any effect outside itself, nor rule over its soul's effecting power, then above the mind in the soul has to be a mind which by its own act is the producer of a work, and is the mistress over the power it has to effect it. It is reason­able to conclude then that just as the head of the soul is the mind, its most excellent part, so at the head of this mind, which belongs not to itself but to the soul, and is not independent but tied to the capacity of the soul, and is not dear but clouded and in a way ir­resolute -at the head of this mind, I repeat, is a mind which ex­ists in itself, free and translucent. Presumably, this explains the riddle of the Magi: "There is something completely clear, some­thing completely murky, something midway, partly clear and partly murky."H In the order of bodies what is completely clear is a star above the Moon, what is completely murky is the air, and in be­tween is the Moon. But in the order of spirits the mind is full of light, the irrational soul is empty of light, and the rational soul is the mean between the two, possessing part of the light of the intel­lect and lacking part. The pare it has from God, like the Moon from the Sun, it receives in different ways at different times, and it changes its shape. Justly, therefore, angel is above soul like a star above the Moon, refulgent with the light of its Sun, entire, forever, unchanging. 


Where the higher nature comes into contact with the lower, there it touches the lower's highest level with its own lowest level. For instance, the lowest level of fire touches the highest level of air. The intellectual nature is superior to the corporeal nature and makes contact with it to the extent that what is most outstanding among bodies may participate in the intellectual soul, but not the lower elements at all, which are legion. Now the most excellent bodies, according to the Platonists, are those of the celestial be­ings, of demons and of men. But are the minds attached to such bodies the highest sorts of minds~ Surely not, or the lower nature would reach the peak of the higher nature without an intermedi­ary. Therefore, just as below bodies endowed with mind is a multitude of bodies without mind, so above minds implanted in bodies is a multitude of minds unattached to any bodies. Indeed, even more of them exist than species of body, for rational souls, as I shall demonstrate elsewhere, have their existence between eter­nity and rime. The excellence of eternity seems to demand that there should be more species, more perfections, in it in a way than exist in time. I shall not dwell on the fact ( which I shall discuss later) that the distance between souls and the first principle is infinite, but the space between souls and matter is finite. Hence it ought to surprise no one that many more degrees of angels are able to exist above souls than degrees of forms below souls.
When a single thing is made up of two components, and the one of them that is less perfect is found to have an independent existence somewhere apart from the other, then a fortiori the one that is more perfect and less in need should be able to exist some­where without the other. An animal is made one from intellectual substance, that is, rational soul, and from body. But we have seen that many bodies exist and are alive without such an intellect. Is there any reason then that prevents many minds from being unat­tached to bodies? Such minds will be above souls united to bod­ies. Minds joined to bodies, insofar as they are minds, do not by themselves constitute the species of animal. They are parts rather of a species which is composite, and in order co understand they mainly consider sensible objects; and on this account they are in some respect imperfect, and they act imperfectly.
In any genus we must ascend from imperfect things to the per feet since the perfect naturally come first. Thus the argument leads us from minds chat are conjoined to minds chat are separate, minds which as species themselves are enough co constitute their own species and which gaze in understanding upon chose things which are in themselves intelligible. Because by way of its under­standing and its will the mind does not depend of necessity on body, it naturally separates forms and treats of them in their sepa­ration. It profits more from rest than from motion and is by na­ture free from the body and from motion. Thus it better suits its nature co live apart from the body and from motion than to live in the body and in motion. Yet many minds do lead a life subject to motion in bodies. Even more reason then for there to be minds, very many of them, leading a life free from motion and separate from bodies. Could anyone deny that it is more proper for an in­corporeal substance, following the nature of its genus, to be out­side the body than to be in the body, and that therefore there should be more species of it separated from the body than species conjoined? For whatever is most natural to a particular genus ex­ists in it to the fullest possible degree. Such then are the angels who move the world's bodies but are not moved at all themselves by the motion of those bodies. Souls, on the other hand, when they set bodies in motion, are themselves moved.


An agent of motion which variously moves together with the body it moves cannot keep the tenor and order of the motion reg­ular and stable unless a motionless mover rules over it. So the perpetual order of the world's revolution is evidence that above souls certain movers exist that are motionless. The elements, be­cause they consist of matter in flux and are always contaminating each ocher, would of themselves preserve no order, unless they were controlled by the strictest law of celestial motion. But since the heaven too is perpetually in motion of itself and therefore wanting, the stable order in its motion does not stem from itself, but from a higher mover that is absolutely motionless and undi­vided. Such stability and oneness does not persist in things so different from each other and so much in motion, unless it is from some axis, completely stable and completely one, which is ulti­mately derived from oneness and stability itself. As what is mov­able is related to what is movable, so mover too is related to mover. So just as an element which is movably moved is related to heaven which is stably moved, so heaven's movable and changeable mover is led back to the mover which is stable and united, and finally what is stable and united is led back to stability and oneness them­selves. The action we refer to as "moving" follows upon the mover; and following upon this action is the passion we refer to as "being moved": it cannot happen the other way round. For the prior are not led by the posterior, but the reverse. It is much more likely that the action we call "moving" should exist somewhere without the passion we call "being moved" than that the passion should ex­ist apart from the action. Yet such a passion in bodies does exist apart from action. Therefore somewhere action will exist far from passion, in order that, just as bodies are moved but do not move, so the angels may move but not be moved. This is what Zoroaster was referring to when he said: "The world has intellectual motion­less rulers."24 So just as souls, which are partly movable and partly motionless, surpass qualities, which are entirely movable, so angels who are entirely motionless surpass souls. 
That angels exist and exist in large numbers Aristotle shows in ro the eleventh book of his Metaphysics: "The movement of the heav­ens, which is continuous, orderly and, as far as its nature permits, without defects, must come about through a mover chat may not be moved either in itself or accidentally. As there are many such movements in the heavens, each separate from the other, different in species and in power, they must be the result of several such movers. These of course cannot be bodies, or they would have to be themselves moved by something when they were imparting mo­rton, and so on necessarily ad infinitum. Nor can they be forms in bodies, or else it would come about that they are moved along with the body chat is moved. We must have recourse to a perfect mover, that is, to the motionless mover, in order to ensure that no motion would ever deviate from its course. Such movers are minds; for in forms that are totally free of matter what is under­stood and what understands are the same ching."25 
Thus Aristotle. It was the Hebrews and later philosophers who n called these minds angels and messengers. Avicenna maintains at one point that the chief angels number no less than ten; but at an­other he seems to indicate there are far more. 26 Aristotle argues that the number of minds is no less than the number of motions in the heavens; and he admitted he had calculated a number using a likely proof, but concluded chat he should leave the matter co others wiser than himself. 27 He suspected, it seems, that the minds should be enumerated according to their own peculiar and principal activity, that is, understanding, and not according to a shared and secondary activity, that is, motion. Moreover, although they may be the final causes of motions, he was prophesying per­haps that the minds should not be reckoned [simply] according to the number of motions, and that a very large number of minds could exist which have not been allocated to imparting motion to bodies. So it is not unreasonable to conclude that the angels are al­most numberless, as I indicated above and will demonstrate now in the following manner. 

If the species of natural objects in matter, although confined within a substrate, are distinguished one from another not because of the substrate but of themselves, and are expanded to the great­est number, then a fortiori the substances, which exist indepen­dently above matter, are distinguished of themselves, and, given the extraordinary fertility of their genus which is freed from mat­ter, are multiplied into species almost without number. Further, an intelligible genus would seem by its very nature to be more eas­ily multiplied than a corporeal one, since numbers, dimensions, shapes, proportions, the density of bodies, the speed of motions, all are limited in bodies themselves. But in mind they are extended at will and without limit. Again, what are particular in matter be­come universal in mind. Finally, intellect, which is beyond all bod­ies, can think at will about innumerable things incorporeal and corporeal alike. Since an intelligible genus can be multiplied much more, therefore, than a sensible genus, and since a potency so valu­able to the universe must not be always in vain, many more species of separate substances than species of bodily substances undoubt­edly exist in act. This is especially since a superior potency accom­plishes its act in the universe more immediately and more effec­tively than a weaker potency. Finally, the fact that the universe's order has been arranged in the best possible manner under the control of an infinite good would seem to require that everything


better in it should, as far as possible, be multiplied and should exceed the quantity of worse things ( especially since inferior things have been made for the sake of the superior). This is obvious if we consider the world spheres. The nobler a sphere is, the bigger it is. Earth and water vis-a-vis the higher spheres we suppose like a point compared to the circumference. What is dimension in bod­ies seems in incorporeal entities to be number. So it is reasonable to infer that, inasmuch as intellectual substances are the best, and have an independent existence, and are the ends at which all cor­poreal entities aim and for which they are created, they muse be far more numerous than both che motions of the spheres and the total number of bodies. Dionysius the Areopagite testifies to this when he says that the species of intellectual entities existing sepa­rately outnumber those of corporeal entities. 23
It is reasonable to suppose that the all-powerful Creator of the universe had the capacity, the knowledge and the will co render His work as most like Himself as possible. He has created it most like Himself in that He has taken the pure minds, which of all things are most like Himself, and has exalted and extended them over and above the forms that are combined with matter by an immeasurable space (if I may call it such). Hence, the saying of the prophet Daniel, "Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten hundred thousands stood before Him."29
In distinguishing the orders of angels, Dionysius made particular use of the numbers three and nine, and occasionally of seven. We find the number twelve in the Christian mysteries. Iamblichus and Proclus, the Platonists, follow Dionysius here.3 °For they di­vide the highest and middle angels into three and nine orders; but the angels who follow are divided into seven orders, and the lowest angels into twelve. Since for the Platonists, however, the different orders of bodies are shadows or reflections [ of the orders] of ratio­nal souls, and the orders of souls are images [of the orders] of the angels, accordingly some distinguish the orders of angels according to the orders of bodies and of souls together. But more of this anon.

Above angel is God; for just as soul is mobile plurality and angel motionless plurality, so God is motionless unity.
Platonists believe that angel is entirely without motion in essence, 1 power and activity; for it is always the same, its capacity is con­stant, it understands everything at the same moment, it wills the same things, and, insofar as it can, it does whatever it does instan­taneously. That is what the Platonists say. The views of ochers I will relate elsewhere. But reason does not permit us to rest at this point [in the argument] with Anaxagoras and Hermotimus; it bids us to mount higher. 
Soul, because it is in motion, passes from one thing to another. So it contains within itself the one thing and the other. Because it has both, it contains plurality. Soul then is in itself a certain plu­rality, a plurality, I repeat, in motion. Angel, which immediately precedes soul, cannot be a motionless unity; because the distance between these two particular things -one a plurality in motion, the other a motionless unity-appears to be too immense. Unity is, of course, the opposite of plurality, and what is motionless, of what is moved. But since in every respect these two are the oppo­site of each ocher, they cannot come one immediately after the other: they need some connecting link. Now angel precedes soul, which is plurality in motion, without any intermediary. Therefore angel cannot be motionless unity, otherwise the two extremes would be joined without an intermediary. But we have already demonstrated that angel is certainly motionless. Thus it cannot be unity. It remains then that angel is motionless plurality. It con­forms to soul in that like soul it is a plurality; but it differs from soul in that it is motionless while soul is moved.


So we are obliged to posit some sort of plurality in angel. But what sore~ Jc has co be a plurality appropriate to intellect, that is, one that has as its essence and being the power of understanding, the act of understanding, and the many species of things under­stood. Bue since angel is not entirely simple but possesses number, and since unity must be above number as the origin of all number and itself not lacking unity ( whereas plurality by its very nature lacks unity), then something else must exist above angel that is not only motionless but entirely one and simple. This is God, the most powerful of all in that He is the simplest of all. Since union consists in simplicity, and power in unity, no one would dare say that God is compounded from many things, because if God were compounded correctly, He would consist of something resembling a substrate and of something else resembling a form. In that case, God would not be in every respect the most perfect, since one part in Him would be less perfect than the other and both parts less perfect than the whole. Nor would God be the highest agent, be­cause He would do whatever He does, not by way of His whole self, but by way of one of His parts, che form. Nor would He be most blessed, because He would not be delighting everywhere in Himself; for He would not be embracing His whole self in every part. He would be seeing something in Himself other than God, since the part and the whole are not the same. Undoubtedly He is more blessed if everything He sees in Himself is Himself, and if He is never absent from Himself but everywhere appears whole to Himself. Finally, the part posited in God as a substrate, because one thinks of it in itself as formless, cannot form itself. The other part which performs the role of form, not having an independent existence, clearly cannot bring itself into existence. Thus chis com­posite god will be formed by some higher form, and that higher 

form rather will be God. So much for the first proof that God is above angel. 
Your mind is to your soul what your eye is to your body. Your 4 mind is the eye of your soul. Similarly, the light of truth bears the same relationship to the eye of your soul as the light of the Sun to your bodily eye. Your bodily eye is not itself light but has the power to perceive light; so coo your mind, che soul's eye, is not it­self the truth though it can perceive the truth. Your mind seeks the truth; but the truth does not seek itself, nor does the truth ad­mit the false by which your mind is often deceived. 
Imagine your eye growing so that it fills your whole body, and, 5 when every species of limb has disappeared, chat the universal body is a single eye. If this ampler eye sees something, it will still see nothing other than the same light of the Sun which it saw when it was confined [to the eye-socket]. But it will receive the same light in greater abundance. In the light everywhere it will see the colors of bodies and see them all together at a single gaze. It will not glance from side to side in order to see, but remaining mo­tionless it will regard everything equally. The light, however, will still be one thing, the eye another. If vision was put in us in order to comprehend light, then vision is one thing, light another. Light has no need of vision, as light itself has no more light to receive. Now imagine that your mind has such power over your soul that with the rest of the parts of the soul effaced, those concerned with imagination, sense and generation, your whole soul is one mind alone. This remaining sole, uncontaminated mind will be angel. This mind, I say, in all its amplitude will look upon the same truth as che mind did when it was confined, but it will receive truth in greater abundance, and in truth will observe all true things at a single gaze (to put it Platonically), and not hunt now for one thing, now for another. Yee mind and truth will still be different things. Zoroaster unfolded it like this: "Be aware that the intelligible lies outside the mind.''31 If che mind has been made to 

perceive the truth, then the mind in need of the truth is different from the truth. For truth has no need of the mind as a way to grasp the truth. Were the mind and the truth the same, every mind would always speak the truth and every truth would partici­pate in mind. But in the event, human minds are deceived, and there are many truths in a way which are missing a mind [ to per­ceive them]. 
Truth is not only different from mind, it is something superior. 6 For the mind needs truth, but truth does not need mind. The do­main of truth extends further than chat of mind. Intellectual art is to be found in individual forms, but is not present in unformed matter. Yet matter is truly called matter and truly it is the sub­strate of all natural objects. But if truth is superior to mind, and because it is superior does not lack inferior goods, then truth does not lack the clarity of mind. However, existing in it are not two things, truth and clarity, but rather simplest truth, truth not hid­ing from itself just as light, though it has no eye separate from itself, does not hide from itself. For God is clearest truth and truest clarity or sight, the light seeing itself the vision giving light to it self. He is the spring of intellectual clarity and light, by whose light and whose light only the clarity of the mind perceives. 32 We say chat wood is hot by a certain participation, but that fire heats in accordance with its form, and chat the Sun hears in a more ex­cellent manner in accordance with its eminent power and as the cause of heat. Similarly, soul participates in mind, angel possesses the form of mind, but God is the all-effecting source of mind. As Plotinus would put it, God is understanding itse!f. n God is not in any particular intellect as its potentiality, and He is not the understanding of the truth as of an object. He is understanding existing in itself and of itself. It is as though vision were not in any sight and were not the vision of an alien light, but remained in itself and were the vision of itself. Intellect exists everywhere as the potenti­ality for understanding, even if it understands itself. Yet insofar as 


it is [itself] intelligible, it is said to be prior in a way to itself inso­far as we think of it as intellectual. For what is intelligible, being first and pre-eminent, moves, forms and perfects the intellectual power which is posterior and inferior to it. That is why some peo­ple call God the intelligible or the understanding rather than the intellect, although, as we shall see later, even these names are not strictly appropriate to God. 
A further argument. The function of the soul is to provide vital 7 motion, since the soul itself is a kind of life. The function of the mind is to order by means of forms. It is itself a kind of form or species and operates by species, as we can see in our own mind. That vital motion ll.ows through every living thing but does not belong to things lacking life. But orderly arrangement by way of forms is proper to even non-living things, for they do not lack or­der and species. Mind is superior to soul to the same extent that the order of forms extends further than life. But because beyond the order of forms is the universe's formless prime matter where certain seeds of forms lie hidden and ferment, if I may put it like that, the office of mind, which is bounded by forms, does not embrace these formless seeds. Yet matter is in a way good because it is desirous of the good, namely of form, and because it is open to receiving the good, and because it is necessary for a good world. Seeds also are good as they are the rudiments of good forms. Goodness exceeds mind to the same degree the distribution of the good extends further than the distribution of the species. The more powerful each thing is, the more far-reaching its acrivicy. 
The following arguments bear on this point. All things desire 8 the good, but all things do not desire mind. For not everything is capable of attaining mind and wisdom, and so there are many things that do not desire it, or else they would desire it to no pur­pose. If all things in desiring are turned towards the good, but not all cowards mind, and if all things turn back in the direction whence they departed, then all things come from the good and not from mind. So the good rather than mind is the first cause of things. Furthermore, what possesses mind does not stop at mind but seeks still for the good. The proper characteristic of mind is a certain striving for understanding. After this striving, the mind is either worse off than it was before, or better, or exactly the same. It cannot be worse off because activity in itself is a sort of perfection, and because nothing deviates towards the worse except through force or ignorance, and neither of these befalls a mind that is pure and free. It cannot be exactly the same, for then it strives in vain, because it accomplishes nothing and nothing strives for what it already has. Therefore mind is trying to improve itself. It follows then that it is not itself the good. For the good cannot improve. In understanding, the mind drinks deep of goodness, but it drinks from a source other than itself. For were it to have this source within, it would not need to strive for it in order to accom­plish its activity. The source from which it quaffs goodness is the good itself, which exists above it, since it can pour down the liquor of its perfection into the mind. We seek wisdom and mind only through the impulse of reason, but we seek the good even before any incitement of the reason. Our every appetite is always for the good, not always for mind. We desire understanding for the sake of the good and not vice versa. Nature then values the good more highly than mind, since it draws us towards the good earlier, more frequently and more strongly. Wherefore some people suppose they have advanced sufficiently far in philosophy if they appear to have wisdom, even though they do not have it. But they do not suppose this of life, unless they truly possess what they judge to be chiefly the good for themselves. 


If the good by natural instinct is regarded as more precious 9 than mind, it is regarded as more eminent. Hence to understand in and of itself is not enough for us, unless we understand cor­rectly and understand the good. For often we reject knowledge for a while, if we suspect it will be bad for us and injurious. But we can never refuse the good. Often too we choose pleasure before the contemplation of things. But we can never choose anything in preference to the good for the reason it is good. Nothing is more a necessity than the inducement of the good, since no one is able not to wish for the good. (Yee) nothing is more voluntary than the inducement of the good, for we wish for all things on account of the good; or rather we wish for the good everywhere in all things so freely and so joyfully that we also wish to be incapable of not wishing it. Thus, since in the good the highest necessity coincides with the highest freedom, and the sovereignty of the good is both entirely a necessity for its subjects and entirely a matter of free will, it is agreed chat all things take their origin from it as from their father, and chat all things aspire to it as to their fatherland.
